rtp file sizes that worked:

(1) 40000 profiles, 5000 channels (both robs1 and rcalc),
    80 levels, 6 gases

(2) 36000 profiles, 5000 channels (both robs1 and rcalc),
    102 levels, and 16 gases.

For both cases, the result is close to a 2 Gbyte file.  Trying some
other combinations, and dropping the number of profiles to stay
below the 2Gb limit, 6000 channels seems to work OK, with both robs1
and rcalc.  Dropping rcalc, I can get 8000 channels, but not 8500,
which I think we'd need for IASI.

These tests are done by setting header fields mlevs, memis, nchan,
ngas, glist, and ptype.  These need to be less than MAX limits set
in rtp.h and rtpdefs.f.

There are HDF 4 file, field, and Vdata record size limits set in the
hdf libs include file hlimits.h:

  #define VDATA_BUFFER_MAX 1000000
  #define MAX_FIELD_SIZE     65535

It's not clear that I'm hitting either of these.  The radiance
fields with lots of channels are the closest, but that doesn't
explain why dropping rcalc lets me fit in more obs, that seems more
like an overall Vdata record limit.

The test function rtpsize will do some sanity checks on field sets,
and sizes.  This should be run after any modification of parameters
or fields.
