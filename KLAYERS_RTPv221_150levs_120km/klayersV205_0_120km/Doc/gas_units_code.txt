C
C      This is the recommended list of code numbers for various
C      gas amount units.  The list is not complete; it includes
C      only the most common units.  Additional units can be added
C      where ever there is a free number.
C
C      An attempt has been made to organize the gas amount units
C      into classes so that similar units have similar numbers.
C      This is merely an attempt to make it easier for users to
C      search the list for some particular unit.
C
C      The gas amount unit classes are as follows:
C         -9999 = no data
C             0 = unknown units
C        1 -  9 = integrated column density (aka cross-sectional density)
C       10 - 19 = volume mixing ratio
C       20 - 29 = mass mixing ratio
C       30 - 39 = partial pressure
C       40 - 49 = water vapor humidity
C       50 - 59 = none-of-the-above oddball units
C
C      Note: The Earth's "air" is a composite of various molecules
C      and atoms whos proportions vary in time and space.  There
C      is an implicit assumed composition of "air" in some of the
C      gas amount units, and not all gas units are based on the same
C      assumption.  There are two commonly used air types which
C      I will refer to as "dry air" and "wet air". Below about
C      100 km altitude the Earth's air has a fairly uniform bulk
C      composition, and the air can be approximated as composed
C      of imaginary "dry air" molecules (with mass 28.97 AMU) plus
C      minor trace constituents.  Over 99.9% of "dry air" is
C      composed of N2, O2, and argon, all of which are nearly
C      inactive in the infra-red portion of the spectrum.  The
C      only IR active gas which typically varies enough to affect
C      the overall bulk composition of air by more than a tiny
C      fraction of a percent is water vapor.  The distinction
C      between "wet" and "dry" air can affect the mixing ratio in
C      the lower troposphere by a few percent.

C      -----   ---------------------------------------------------------
C      -9999   no data
C
C          0   unknown units (?)
C              It's something but you don't know what
C
C              ------- 1-9 = integrated column density -----------------
C              AKA cross-sectional density.
C              The gas amount in a particular volume of air has been
C              integrated over its vertical thickness.  This implicit
C              "thickness" is a separate piece of info which is required
C              to correctly interpret the meaning of the gas amount.

C              of some column of ozone if it were squashed down to STP.
