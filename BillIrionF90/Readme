Hi Sergio,

Thanks for your call this afternoon.

I’ve been slowly moving SARTA from just a translation to F90 to where I’ve been modularizing it in a (vain?) effort to speed it up.

The files in
/home/fwi/dev/sarta_pclsam_d4s/sarta_pclsam_d4s_f90_v1/  (on weather)
are mostly just a translation from F77 to F90 with some modularization, and inclusion of the calculation of outgoing radiance using D4S transmissivity as input.

The files in
/home/fwi/dev/sarta_pclsam_d4s/sarta_pclsam_d4s_f90_v10/
are much more modularized, and save calculated variables between calls.  I have NOT done much as far as speeding up the cloud calculation.

Please feel free to touch base if I can help further.

Cheers,
Bill
