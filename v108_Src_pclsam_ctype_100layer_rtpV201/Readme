1)
see /home/sergio/MATLABCODE/LES/check_sarta.m
this diffs files in 
  /home/sergio/SARTA_CLOUDY/v107_Src
versus
  /asl/packages/sartaV108/Src_rtpV201

and tells me that
  calnte.f are different 
  calpar.f are different 
  calrad.f are different 
  calt1.f are different 
  calt2.f are different 
  calt4.f are different 
  calt5.f are different 
  calt6.f are different 
  calt7.f are different 
  opnrtp.f are different 
  rdinfo.f are different 
  rdrtp.f are different 
  sarta.f are different 
  setems.f are different 
  tunmlt.f are different 
  wrtrtp.f are different 
  

2) So I need to copy these from /asl/packages/sartaV108/Src_rtpV201 into this dir
using copy.sc

3) also edit make_sarta_pclsam so that
# set RTPHOME to point to the local RTP installation
#RTPHOME = /asl/packages/rtpV105_4500
RTPHOME = /asl/packages/rtpV201

4) type make and notice
  a) need ntebot 
     so look at infFTC and include that

5) then barf at "cemis" at getcld.f so need to fix that; for hints, check out 
       ../Src_rtpV201_pclsam_slabcloud_hg3/getcld_slab.f
