Introduction:
------------
KLAYERS is a program for converting a "levels"-type profile (ie
point values) into a integrated "layer"-type profile (ie slab
values) of the type needed for use with the SARTA and KCARTA
programs.  KLAYERS requires the RTP package; you must build
the RTP library before you can compile KLAYERS.

The KLAYERS code is "data driven"; that is, the data itself
(from the input RTP file) provides most of the instructions
concerning the processing.  Additional instructions (such
as file names) are provided by the user by means of command-line
arguments.


Platform-Specific Considerations and Limitations:
------------------------------------------------
The FORTRAN source code makes use of the non-standard (but common
extension) "STRUCTURE" type variables.  If your compiler can not
handle STRUCTURE variables, you will not be able to use KLAYERS.


Performance:
------------
The program is fairly quick.  On a ~500 MHz linux workstation, we
processed 16000 profiles in roughly 4 minutes.


Command-Line Arguments
----------------------
KLAYERS gets some of its process instructions from command-line
arguments.  Default values are used for all non-specified arguments.
(Note: defaults are hardcoded in source code file "rdinfo_klayers.f")

Each command line argument is a string of the form
   <variable>=<value>.
Each argument string must be 80 characters or less.  It is not
necessary to enclose the <value> in quotes unless the string includes
blanks.  The recognized  command-line variables are:

    fin : name of input file.
       {default fin=klayers_in.rtp)

    fout : name of output file.
       {default fout=klayers_out.rtp)

    fnafgl : name of AFGL model profile file.
       {default fnafgl=DFAFGL, where DFAFGL is a string assigned
        in the "incLAY.f" include file.}

    mnafgl : AFGL model number (integer).  This is the model
       profile that will be used to fill any holes in the user
       supplied profile.  There are six model profiles:
       1 = Tropical
       2 = Midlatitude Summer
       3 = Midlatitude Winter
       4 = Subarctic Summer
       5 = Subarctic Winter
       6 = U.S. Standard
       {default mnafgl=6}

    nwant : number of desired gases (integer 1 to MXGAS, or -1=all).
       If nwant=-1, all gases will be used and listg must not
       be specified.  Otherwise listg must be specified and it must
       contain nwant number of entries.
       {default nwant=4}
       HINT: do not set nwant=-1 unless you are using the "kcarta"
       version of the rtp library (there are too many gases to fit
       in the usual version).

    listg : list of gas IDs (integers separated by a comma).
       Alternately the IDs may be specified using a quoted string
       containing integers separated by a blank space.  Examples:
          listg=1,2,3,4,5
          listg='1 2 3 4 5'
       Note: due to the 80 char limit, the max number of entries
       in listg is limited. (Eg up to 25 two- digit numbers).
       {default listg=1,3,5,6}

    toff : offset to be applied to the temperatures of the output
       layer profile.  It is recommended you ignore this option
       and leave the default set to zero.
       {default toff=0.0}

    scaleh : scale height in kilometers (real).  The scale height
       is only used for some relatively minor calculations, so
       in general it is recommended you ignore this and leave
       the default set to seven.
       {default scaleh=7.0}

    ldry : AFGL mixing ratios are for dry air? (true/false or T/F).
       See the note below for the meaning of "wet" and "dry"  air.  
       {default ldry=true}

    lsvp : check if water exceeds the sataturation vapor pressure?
       (true/false or T/F).  If lsvp=true and the water mixing ratio
       exceeds the SVP, the water is reset to the SVP amount.
       {default lsvp=true}

    lsplin : interpolate profile using splines? (true/false or T/F).
       It is recommended you ignore this option and leave the default
       set to false.  Splines may seem like a good idea but they
       have a tendency to occasionally blow up.
       {default lspline=false}

    lpmax : extend profile to Pmax? (true/false or T/F).  If true,
        the profile will be extended down to the layering grid's
        maximum pressure instead of stopping at whichever layer
        contains PSURF.
        {default lpmax=false}

Note: the meaning of "dry" and "wet" mixing ratios:
    "wet"= the effects of water vapor on the make-up of the air has
        already been factored into the mixing ratio values.  The mixing
        ratios do not need any further adjustment.
    "dry"=the mixing ratios are with respect to "dry air"; that is,
        air without any water vapor present.  The supplied values
        should be adjusted for the presence of water vapor before
        being used in profile calculations.


Summary of required RTP input file variables:
--------------------------------------------
The following variables should be properly filled out in the RTP
input file read in by KLAYERS.  If any of these variables are left
blank, KLAYERS will be lacking some vital piece of data or
instructions.  If that happens, KLAYERS might either refuse to do
the processing, or it might try to plow thru it, in which case you
should expect screwy output.

Hint: screwy output is much more likely to be the result of
screwy input than true problems with KLAYERS.

See the RTP documentation for more info on these variables.

header fields:
ptype   = profile type; must be code value 0 (ie "levels" not "layers")
pfields = profile fields bit flags; must have PROFBIT set
ngas    = number of gases
glist   = gas ID list; must include gases 1 (H20), 3(O3), 5 (CO), and 6 (CH4)
gunit   = gas amount units; must be code value 1 or 2

profile fields:
plat    = profile latitude
spres   = surface pressure
nlevs   = number of levels
plevs   = pressure levels
ptemp   = temperature profile
gas_#   = gas amount (where # is each gas ID number in glist)



Profile Units:
-------------
Input profiles: discrete data points in the atmosphere
   latitude: degrees
   gas IDs: same notation as the HITRAN'98 database (see gas list below)
   pressure levels: millibars (mb) [equivalent to hectoPascals (hPa)]
   temperature: Kelvin (K)
   mixing ratio: see "gas_units_code.txt".  The prefered unit is dry
      air PPMV, but other units are allowed (see "Src_klayers/cbgucs.f").
   surface pressure: millibars
   surface altitude (optional but recommended): meters
   level altitudes (optional): meters

   Note: the KLAYERS program works by starting the calculations at the
   bottom of the bottom-most required layer.  The altitude calculation
   is initialized by extrapolation of the surface altitude down to the
   bottom of the layer.  If no surface altitude is provided, the code
   will calculate a surface altitude using the equation
      pressure = 1013.25*exp(-altitude/scale_height)
   The default scale_height is 7 kilometers, but this may be set to
   some other value using the KLAYERS command-line argument "SCALEH"
   as discussd in the following section.

Output profiles: integrated/averaged data on the 100 AIRS layers
   layer average pressure: millibars (mb) [equivalent to hPa]
   layer average temperature: Kelvin (K)
   altitude at approximate center of layer: meters
   gas integrated layer absorber amount: molecules per square centimeter
      (molecules/cm^2).
   cloud integrated layer absorber amount: grams per square meter (g/m^2).



HITRAN Gas List:
---------------
See file: gas_xsec_ids.txt



Cloud ID numbers:
----------------
These are fake "gas" ID numbers which are used as a numeric label
to uniquely identify each cloud. By itself the ID does not imply
any particular set of cloud properties.

201 = cloud1 amount
202 = cloud2 amount
203 = cloud3 amount

301 = cloud1 particle size
302 = cloud2 particle size
303 = cloud3 particle size


Comments:
--------
Our layering program was originally written as a special purpose replacement
for the layering program included with David Edward's GENLN2 (line-by-line
monochromatic transmittance and radiance) package.  To maintain compatibility,
the output was originally in the format required by GENLN2.  However, the
output of the layering program KLAYERS supplied in this package no longer
follows the GENLN2 format.

The KLAYERS program was written to support both our fast forward
model for the AIRS satellite instrument, as well as KCARTA, our
semi-fast monochromatic code.   The RTP (Radiative Transfer Profile)
format has been developed as a means of pulling together all the info
needed to specify a radiative transfer calculation.

The KLAYERS program always calculates an atmosphere spanning complete
AIRS layers.  In particular, this means that even if the bottom
surface does not fall exactly on a layer boundary, KLAYERS will still
calculate a complete bottom layer rather than a fractional bottom
layer.  This is because the AIRS fast model requires complete layers.

It is up to the user to provide a sensible profile for the entire
portion of the atmosphere in which they are interested.  The KLAYERS
code will augment the supplied profile if needed to span the required
range, but there is no guarantee the KLAYERS program will do a good
job!

The user supplied profile can be augmented by one of the following
six AFGL model profiles:
      Model 1. Tropical
      Model 2. Midlatitude Summer
      Model 3. Midlatitude Winter
      Model 4. Subarctic Summer
      Model 5. Subarctic Winter
      Model 6. U.S. Standard
The choice of model is specified using a command-line argument.


Overview of the FORTRAN programming:
-----------------------------------
The heart of the supplied code are the two routines "intlev" and "integ".
This is where the vast majority of the actual work is done, the other
routines dealing mainly with housekeeping duties (such as load or writing
files, etc) or minor calculations.

The KLAYERS program is designed to use these two routines to convert an input
profile into a profile of the type required by kCARTA.  The KLAYERS program:
   Asks the user for info about the profile (using RDINFO)
   Opens the input and output RTP files
   Loops over the profiles
      Reads in the profile file (using RDRTP)
      Interpolates the profile levels onto a set of fine AIRS sub-levels
         (using INTLEV)
      Integrate the sub-levels to get the averaged and integrated layer
         values (using INTEG).
      Writes the layer profile to output (using WRTRTP)
   Closes RTP files and then done.
Along with calls to these routine, the program also performs some minor
calculations and housekeeping duties.

Routine INTLEV interpolates an input profile onto a set of AIRS sub-levels.
The sub-levels are the 100 AIRS layer divided into finer meshes to form
sub-layers (defined by these sub-levels).  The layer sub-division is adjusted
as needed to ensure that each input profile data point (in the range covered
by the AIRS layers) is accounted for in the sub-levels.

This interpolation assumes a linear relationship between the logarithm of air
pressure and temperature, mixing ratio, and altitude.  If profile altitudes
are not supplied, they are calculated recursively, working upward from the
1100 mb level using a user supplied value of the altitude at this level, and
then using the hydrostatic equation to calculate each layer's thickness.  The
use of the hydrostatic equations requires we calculate gravity (using GRAV)
for each sub-level.

INTLEV can also be told to check the water profile to see if it is
over-saturated (using WEXSVP), and if so truncate it's value to 100% humidity
and write a warning to the screen.  The program also checks the bottom-most
(largest pressure) levels to see if the interpolation is reasonable.  Here
"reasonable" means within 10K in temperature and a factor of two in mixing
ratio of the last supplied input data point.  If the interpolation is outside
these bounds, the interpolated profile is truncated to these values and a
warning is written to the screen.

Routine INTEG integrates the sub-layers to form the 100 AIRS layer values of
temperature and absorber amounts (and layer pressure, which is independent of
input profile).  The absorber amounts are calculated using the ideal gas law to
compute "air" density, which is then multiplied by the layer thickness and
mixing ratio to determine absorber amount. The sum of the sub-layers gives the
total layer integrated absorber amount.  An average layer temperature is
computed using the "air amount" in the sub-layers as a weight.  A sum of the
weighted sub-layer temperatures is divided by the sum of the weights to yield
the average layer temperature.
