Comments for using KLAYERS with AERI layers
*******************************************

----------
IMPORTANT!
----------
When running KLAYERS for AERI profiles, the surface pressure *MUST* be
set to the AERI bottom layer pressure, and the surface altitude should
be set to the altitude at the particular AERI instrument's location!

Note that this means you can NOT use the same exact RTP input profile
files for different AERI layers; you will need a separate RTP input
file (with appropriate sureface pressure and altitide) for each!


AERI layer sets:
---------------
Currently there are 9 different AERI layers, arranged in 3 sets
of 3 different types per set.  Each AERI layer type consists of
100 layers (101 levels) and runs from the specified bottom
pressure to 0.0050 mb.  The sets and bottom pressures are:

1013 +- 20 = 1033, 1013,  993 mb  (UMBC-McMillan & TWP(Nauru) ARM/CART set)

 980 +- 19 =  999,  980,  961 mb  (SGP(Oaklohoma) ARM/CART set)

 680 +- 13 =  693,  680,  667 mb  (MLO-Strow (Mau Loa Observatory) set)


UMBC-McMillan:  University of Maryland Baltimore County site (30m?)
   or same instrument temporarily located on Cheasapeake Bay (10m?).
   Operated by Wallace McMillan (UMBC).

TWP: Tropical Western Pacific ARM/CART site on Nauru island (10m?)

SGP: Southern Great Plains ARM/CART site mostly located in northern
    Oaklahoma (315-365m).  There are 5 AERI's here.

MLO-Strow: Mauna Loa Observatory site (3397m).  Operated by
    Larrabee Strow (UMBC).
