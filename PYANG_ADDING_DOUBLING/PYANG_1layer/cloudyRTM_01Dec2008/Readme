Dear Sergio,

Jun Li's group rewrote the fast IR model code.  It's now in his ftp site. 
Please use this version.

It will be appreciated if you could acknowledge Jun Li's contribution in 
relevant publications.

best regards,

-Ping

Hi Sergio,
A little background may be useful - the original fast model for cloud 
radiances was built by a fellow named Heli Wei when he was visiting Texas A&M 
a few years ago. He has since gone back to China. Ping was trying to 
reconstitute this software in his shop but luckily, a colleague of ours, Jun 
Li (pronounced June) here at CIMSS has been working with the fast model since 
Heli left. In fact, Jun and his colleagues have made a number of improvements 
to the original model. So if you are interested in delving into cloud 
properties and bringing in surface emissivity, it may be better to work with 
Jun's version of the model at this point. I am sure you will have questions; 
if so, Jun can be reached at jun.li@ssec.wisc.edu

I am not sure about the details however. My apologies for this.

Hope this information helps a bit.

Bryan
