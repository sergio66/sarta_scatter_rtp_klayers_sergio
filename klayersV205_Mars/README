klayersV205_Mars is a modification of Scott Hannon's klayersV205, to
work for a Martian atmosphere.

All the ideas are the same, with the expected differences, such as
planet radius and gravity.

Key changes include
a) the standard profile (found in Data/glmars.dat)
b) the pressure levels grid (found in Grid/cbplev_mars.f)
c) the GasIDs : initial commit has 6 gases
 (1) WV (2) CO2 (3) N2 (4) O3 (5) CO (6) NO
d) so that means there are no xsec gases

The driver for all of these three is is 
  Matlab/make_airs_std_p_T.m
and
  Matlab/test_ip_rtp.m makes an rtp file with an arbitrary (close) profile, which
  could be close to the Mars Standard Profile
and
  Matlab/mars_standard_profile_sergioMay2021_rtp.m makes the Data/glmars.dat      Mars Standard Profile
                                                   makes the Data/RefgasMars/refgas*  standard profiles
                                                     used by kCARTA

The Test directory allows you to test the code, and compare Earth spectra vs Martian spectra
