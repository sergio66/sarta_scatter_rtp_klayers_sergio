Recommended HITRAN gas and cross-section gas ID numbers.
Updated: 27 August 2010, S.Hannon

Comments:
   Gas IDs 1-42 correspond to the HITRAN 2008 database.  Gas IDs
   40-42 are new for HITRAN2008.

   Gas IDs 51-63 are the numbers we (UMBC) use with some of the
   cross-section gases included in the XSEC supplement to the
   HITRAN 2000 database.  We extended the XSEC IDs to 64-81
   in July 2010.

   Gas IDs 101 and 102 are the numbers used by the kCARTA program
   to specify the self- and foreign-broadened components of the
   water continuum. 103 refers to the HDO isotope of water.  The
   HDO mixing ratio in the troposphere often differs from H2O by
   ~15% due to HDO's reduced evaporation and enhanced precipation.

   Gas IDs 201 and above are the IDs we (UMBC) use to specify clouds
   profiles (amounts).  These cloud IDs are merely a numeric label
   to identify a particular cloud profile, and they do imply any
   particular set of cloud properties other than the profile.
   That is, "201" means "this profile is for cloud1" regardless
   of composition of the cloud, particle size, etc.  In general
   the cloud profile should will need to be supplemented by a
   separate set of RTP fields to specify all additional relevant
   cloud properties (cloud type code number, particle size, cloud
   fraction, et cetera).
