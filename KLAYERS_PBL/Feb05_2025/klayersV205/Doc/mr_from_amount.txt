These notes describe how it is possible to accurately deduce layer
average dry air volume mixing ratio from layer column density.  The
algorithm has been developed for use with the AIRS fast model.

Values of important constants: 
   Loschmidt = 2.6867775E+19 molecules per cm^3 (at 1 atm and 273.15 K)
   kAvogadro = 6.022142E+26 molecules per kilomole
   T0 = 273.15 K

In the following discussion, all profile values are layer average
values.  

For a homogeneous air path, the relationship between column density
and mixing ratio is:

1)   CD_i = PP_i/kAvogadro * dz *  T0/T * Loschmidt

with

2a)   PP_i = MR_i * Ptotal

where
   CD_i is the column density of gas "i" (kilomoles/cm^2)
   PP_i is the partial pressure of gas "i" (atm)
   dz is the pathlength (cm)
   T is the gas temperature (K)
   MR_i is the volume mixing ratio of gas "i" expressed as the
      number of gas "i" molecules per total number of molecules
      making up the air.
   Ptotal is the total air pressure (atm)

The above equations are relatively simple, but unfortunately they
reply upon an accurate value for the pathlength, "dz", which is not
available to the AIR fast model code.  The layer thickness is a
function of temperature, gravity, and air mass.  In particular,
latitude affects gravity (as does altitude) and water vapor affects
air mass (in the lower troposphere).  In addition the atmosphere is
not really homogenous over the thickness of the AIRS layers; the
profiles typically change continuously with altitude.  (Our KLAYERS
code assumes they vary linearly in log(Pressure)). The layer
thicknesses can be computed by integrating the atmosphere if the
gas mixing ratios are known, but the reverse problem is more
difficult.  However, this is a problem which has indirectly already
been solved and built into the AIRS fast model: the "fixed gases"
adjustment.

Of the many gases making up "air", water vapor is the only gas that
varies enough in the atmosphere to have a significant effect upon
the structure of the atmosphere.  In the lower tropopause water
might be anywhere from a hundredth of a percent to a few percent of
the molecules making up the air.  For this reason, we distinguish
between dry-air, which includes all gases except water vapor, and
wet-air, which includes all gases including water.  Water molecules
are less massive than the average mass of the many particules making
up dry air (mostly N2), and so water vapor acts to decrease air mass
and thus affects the relationship between pressure and altitude.  In
addition, because water in the lower troposphere may be as much as a
few percent of the total air molecules, water can reduce the mixing
ratios of the dry gases by displacing a little of the dry air.

We now modify equation (2a) to introduce a distinction between
dry-air and wet-air mixing ratios:

2b)   PP_i = MRwet_i * Ptotal = MRdry_i * (Ptotal - PP_water)

The AIRS fast model retrieves layer column densities and average
temperatures.  It does not start with profile point values and
then integrate the atmosphere to form layers; it directly assigns
layer values without ever dealing with anything else.  This is
fine for the variable gases, but it complicates the problem of
accurately deducing the corresponding fixed gases layer column
densities.  To work around this problem, I developed a simple
parameterized adjustment factor for the fixed gases column
densities.  This factor takes into account the effects of
temperature, gravity/latitude, and water vapor displacement on
the layer column densities (and thus the optical depth).
 
3)   fmult = ( 1 - pmult*PP_x )/( fx * gscal )

such that

4)   CD_fixed = CD_fixed_ref * fmult

where

   PP_x = PP_i as in equation (1) for water CD_i, but using dz = dzref
      instead of the true (but unknown) layer thickness.   This is
      NOT intended as a good estimate of the water partial pressure
      (and it isn't!); it is simply the appropriate term for use in
      equation (3).

   gscal = scaling factor for gravity
      gscal = ( 9.78050518 + 0.0518017*( COS( (lat - 90.0)*pi/180))^2 )/
         9.80683613
      where lat is the latitude (degrees).  This term is basically
      the ratio of gravity at sea level for the profile of interest
      (the numerator) and the reference profile (the denominator).

   pmult = 0.58 = empirically determined coefficient for term PP_x.
      This coefficient is more than just the mass ratio of water vapor
      to dry air; it includes a fit adjustment factor.

   fx = empirically determined coefficient with a unique value for
      every layer.  This term is a minor tweak used to remove the
      small bias error of the calculated fmult.  The value is close
      to unity in all 100 layers.

Equation (3) is an approximation, but I estimate it to be accurate to
within a couple tenths of a percent for any plausible profile.  This
equation is already implemented in the AIRS code; it is evaluated for
the profile to assign a value to fmult for all 100 layers.

Since there is no such thing as "fixed" gases, the reference profile
values were arbitrary chosen to be represented by CO2.  The standard
(unperturbed) CO2 dry-air mixing ratio is known; it's value is read
in to the AIRS level2 processing code along with the other reference
profile values.  MRdry_fixed = 370 parts per million in all layers
(actually slightly less in the top few layers but we can ignore
this minor variation).

With equations (1), (2b), and (4), plus the complete profile
information (CD_fixed_ref, Tref, dzref, and MRdry_fixed) for the
reference profile "fixed" gases, we now have a means of solving for
the (layer average) dry air mixing ratio of all gases from their
retrieved 100 layer column densities and temperature profile.  The
may be done as follows:

If we plug equation (1) and (2b) into the left side of equation (4),
we have one equation and two unknowns: PP_water and dz.  If we
re-arranging equation (1) for water, we can express PP_water
as a function of the the known CD_water and the unknown dz.  Thus we
end up with two equations and two unknowns, which we can now solve
for both unknowns.  With dz and PP_water now determined, it is a
simple matter to calculate MRdry_i for ozone, carbon monoxide, and
methane by a simple re-arrangement of equations (1) and (2b).

What we end up with are layer average mixing ratios, not mixing
ratios at discreet pressure levels.  However, if we choose to
treat the layer average values (both mixing ratio and temperature)
as discrete level values at the layer average pressure, then we
may interpolate the profile onto any arbitrary pressure grid.  For
consistency with KLAYERS and the fixed gases adjustment, this may
be done via a linear interpolation in log(Pavg), where
   Pavg = (P2-P1)/log(P2/P1).


Here is one additional useful equation which can easily be
derived from equation 2b above.  Since
   PP_water = MRwet_water * Ptotal
then if we divide both sides of equation 2b by Ptotal we get

2c)   MRwet_i = MRdry_i * (1 - MRwet_water) for any gas i

Note that equation 2c is valid for any gas i, including water.
